About Zutil
===============================================================================
	Zutil is a collection and demonstration of utilities written in the C 
language. It is free and open-source, you can do as you like with it so long as
you follow the terms of the license. The source code is released under the zlib
license in the hope that it may be useful for other people, however it does not 
offer any warranty that it is suitable for any particular purpose, even those 
for which it was specifically written. Zutil is written primarily in standard C
(1989, ANSI). C89 is well supported across platforms and compilers. 

 

Zutil coding guidelines
===============================================================================  
The top priority in code style is readability. Generally, checking the 
surrounding code and trying to imitate it is good practice as consistency is
part of what makes code easy to follow. The extra time required to properly
format the code is well worth it in the long run as it makes sections easier to
locate, understand, debug, and maintain.

Lines of code are to be no longer than 80 characters long. This amount of text 
is easy to fit in most monitors with a decent font size. It also puts less 
strain on human eyes to not have to scan horizontally back and forth. Lines
longer than 80 characters, or have too many levels of indentation, become hard
to read, and means that you should restructure your code.  



Braces and Spacing
===============================================================================  
Brace placement closely follows that of the traditional K&R format, and Tabs 
with a length of 4 characters are used. Placing braces on the same line as the
statement conserves vertical space and keeps the code neat and compact.
Example:

    for (it = 0; it < num_elements; it++) {
        foo[it] = foo[it] + 42;
    
    	if (foo[it] < 35) {
    	    printf ("Foo!");
    	    foo[it]--;
    	}
	else {
    	    printf ("Bar!");
    	    foo[it]++;
    	}
    }



Function declarations in header files
===============================================================================  
Headers files are where the public interface is, and it's important to have a
well laid out format that is easy to understand and yet desciptive. In this
way, the format itself serves as documentation.
Public function declarations should be formatted as such:

Line 1:  <export> <return-type> <calling convention>
Line 2:  <function name>
Line 3:      <annotation> <argument 1>
Line 4:      <annotation> <argument 2>
Line 5:      <annotation> <argument 3>
             <annotation> and so on...

Example:
         extern int ZAPI
         CopyString(
             _Inout_ char*        _dst,
             _In_    const char*  _src,
             _In_    unsigned int _dstlen);

Notice that annotations, arguments types, and argument variable names
are aligned into vertical columns. This format aims to create an easier
to read layout so that you can quickly understand each part of the function.



Naming conventions
===============================================================================  
- Functions:
  names use captial CamalCase. It may have underscores to distinguish
  it as being part of a specific interface. 
  For example:
               void ZThread_Join();
  
  Note that "ZThread" is seperated by underscore from "Join". This says that 
  the function is part of an interface called ZThread and the action that the
  function performs is to "Join".

   
  
- Variables:
  names should be kept as short as possible yet still descriptive of what they
  represent. The following are general rules to abide by.

      1. Do not use abreviations. 
             char* myStringVar;  //good name
             char* msv;          //bad name


      2. Types and names should be seperated. For example, if we have a
	     pointer to a char, then the type is char-pointer, the pointer is not
		 part of the name. Notice the asterisk placement:
             char* myStringVar;  //good seperation
             char *myStringVar;  //bad seperation


      3. Names of variables should be either all lowercase or lower-camelCase, 
         and some variables may benefit from having a prefix to indicate their 
	     type and use. Call apon thy best judgement to determine a suitable
	     variable name that looks good and is descriptive. 

         Acceptable examples:
             int iErrorCode; //good. 'i' prefix for integer, name is camelCase
	     int errorcode;  //good. lowercase, has a neat simple appearance.


	  4. If a variable name if for a function parameter, it is to be prefixed
	     with an underscore. See this example of a function declaration and 
		 note that the variables "_dst", "_src", and "_dstlen" are underscored.

		 extern int ZAPI
                 CopyString(
		     _Inout_ char*        _dst,
         	     _In_    const char*  _src,
         	     _In_    unsigned int _dstlen);
    

	  5. For loop iterators, avoid using the old practice of naming it "i".
	     Instead use "it" (short for iterator). 

  
  
  - Constants:
      names of constant values are in all caps. This applies to enumerations,
	  macros, and any type of constant. Words are seperated by underscore.
	  Examples:
	      #define ITERATIONS_COUNT 100         //good name, all caps
	      const Int32 ITERATIONS_COUNT = 100;  //good name, all caps
	      enum { ITERATIONS_COUNT = 100 };     //good name, all caps
		   
	  Note that for enum types, the name of the enum if it has one, is also in
	  all caps and should reflect its values. In addition, you should provide
	  a convenience typedef for enums. The tag name is should be prefixed with 
	  an underscore to differentiate it from the typedef name.
	  Example:
	      typedef enum _COLOR {
	          COLOR_RED,
	          COLOR_GREEN,
	          COLOR_BLUE,
	      } COLOR;
